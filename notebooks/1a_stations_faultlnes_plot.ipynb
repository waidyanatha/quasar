    "# QuaSaR: Identifying EEW Rings - Mapping Station Faults\n",
    "\n",
    "## GOAL AND OBJECTIVES\n",
    "Quake Safety Rings (synonimus with [QuSaR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar)) are essentially autonomous [Rings](https://brilliant.org/wiki/ring-theory/) of sensors sharing discretized time-series of _waveform_ information to identify threats and forewarn to give man and machine a lead time to respond to harmful earthquakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall __gaol__ is to examine how the GeoNet seismic network can be augmented with a low-cost network to offer low-latency EEWs by making use of cutting-edge earthquake picking algorithms and machine learning techniques. The expected outcome is for the findings to serve as evidence for supporting a strategic deployment of a ring or rings of micro-array networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intent is to also make use of the analysis and tools is to serve as inputs for earthquake hazard risk assessment. Thereby, a community interested in operationalizing their own micro-array ring can make us of the analysis and tools to determining whether or not and how they may need to invest in building a micro-array ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "1. _Understand the [topology](https://brilliant.org/wiki/topology/) (structure of connection of the units and their capabilities)_; also an axiomatic way to make sense of when two points in a set are \"near\" each other\n",
    "   1. Retrieve data on all the operational NZ seismic stations to __map the inventory__ by types and location [git-issue #2](https://github.com/waidyanatha/quasar/issues/2).\n",
    "   1. Build a __statoion fault topology space__ comprising all the operational stations within a bound of the fault line paths; such that we create a metric space _(X,d)_ comprising _X = { x,y | for all coordinate pairs of stations x and faults y}_ and a [haversine](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/993236/calculating-a-perpendicular-distance-to-a-line-when-using-coordinates-latitude) distance function _d = x - y_; relative to the fault lines, stations, and earthquake detection role and capacity \n",
    "   1. Cluster the metric space into partially ordered __coarser topology__ of metric subspaces; essentially to make a nearest neigbour map of station fault clusters such that stations are within ___d < &epsilon;___ distance to ensure optimal EEW application performance; \n",
    "1. _Apply earthquake __picking algorithms__ on the GeoNet wave form data_\n",
    "   1. Test the __standard GeoNet algorithms__ (e.g. LTS/STS, Pd, Wavefields)\n",
    "   1. Test with new __machine learning and wavefield algorithms__ (e.g. , 8bit Picking, PLUM)\n",
    "   1. Test above picking algorithms with __simulated earthquakes__ and for __selected high risk faults__ to observe the response of the picking algorithms\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. _Determine ways for improving the station rings for an incremental effectiveness of EEW_\n",
    "   1. Propose to __fit additional stations__ to improve the 30Km nearest neighbour cluster; then show how that improves the picking\n",
    "   1. Apply the geodedic methodology to __interpolate seismic data__ for the proposed station locations \n",
    "   1. Try the earthquake __picking algorithms__ on the hypothetical network to measure effectiveness"
