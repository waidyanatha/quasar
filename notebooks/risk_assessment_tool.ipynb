    "In a citizen-led approach to building a community-based earthquake early warning system one must decide the costs benifits of investing in an EEW application. For such the user must be able to:\n",
    "1. Assess and perceive their risk to earthquakes; given the vulnerability, exposure, and cost\n",
    "1. Determine the ideal micro-array for their EEW application\n",
    "1. Calculate the total cost of ownership of the EEW application\n",

    "## Risk Assessment Tool\n",
